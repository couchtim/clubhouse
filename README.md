# Simple Couchapp from the Ground Up

This is the code that accompanies my tutorial, [Simple Couchapp from the
Ground Up][tut].

This code is available under the BSD license. It is &copy; 2010 Tim
Smith. Licencing info for the tutorial text is available on its web
page.

This git repository contains the source code, in the `master` branch,
and also the full source of the tutorial text, in the `gh-pages` branch.

This is a work in progress. My plan is to split this into multiple blog
postings and release it over some amount of time. By the end, I'll have
basically implemented all of the functionality in [Mikeal's
node.couchapp.js][node.couchapp.js], plus a fairly complete Couchapp. I
want to cover Couchapp replication, and authentication and security
issues.
